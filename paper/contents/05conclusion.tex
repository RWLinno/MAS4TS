\section{Conclusion}

We introduced MAS4TS, a novel multi-agent system for general time series analysis. Through visual anchoring and numerical reasoning, MAS4TS achieves state-of-the-art performance on forecasting, classification, imputation, and anomaly detection while maintaining high efficiency. Our work demonstrates that decomposing complex tasks into specialized agents with parallel execution offers a promising alternative to monolithic foundation models. Future work will explore: (1) integrating vision-language models for richer semantic priors, (2) extending to online/continual learning scenarios, (3) applying MAS4TS to multivariate causal inference, and (4) developing agent communication protocols for even tighter collaboration. We hope MAS4TS inspires further research at the intersection of multi-agent systems and time series analysis.
