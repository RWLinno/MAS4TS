Time series analysis is crucial for applications in finance, healthcare, and IoT, yet existing approaches face two key challenges: (1) single large models exhibit low token utilization and slow inference, and (2) most methods focus on a single task, limiting generalization across classification, forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MAS4TS}, a novel multi-agent system for general time series analysis that leverages parallel inference and unified decision-making. Specifically, instead of relying on a single token-inefficient model, we deploy multiple task-specific models with concurrent inference, coordinated by a unified manager agent. At the core of MAS4TS are two key innovations: (1) \textit{Visual Anchoring}, where a specialized agent observes time series visualizations to generate ``anchors'' for historical and future data along with semantic priors, and (2) \textit{Numerical Reasoning}, where another agent combines anchors, temporal data, and semantic information to perform precise numerical inference. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MAS4TS achieves state-of-the-art performance on forecasting, classification, imputation, and anomaly detection tasks, while maintaining strong generalization and high inference efficiency. Code and models are available at \url{https://github.com/RWLinno/MAS4TS}.
