Time series analysis is fundamental to applications across finance~\cite{idrees2019prediction}, healthcare~\cite{karevan2020transductive}, energy systems~\cite{deb2017review}, and IoT~\cite{zheng2020traffic}. Recent advances in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series~\cite{jin2023time,liu2024unitime} have demonstrated improved generalization and contextual understanding compared to specialized models. However, these approaches face critical limitations: \textbf{(1) Efficiency}: LLMs exhibit low token utilization and slow inference due to their sequential nature, and \textbf{(2) Generalization}: Most methods target a single task (e.g., forecasting), failing to generalize across the diverse requirements of classification, imputation, and anomaly detection.

\textbf{Multi-agent systems} have recently shown promise in complex reasoning tasks~\cite{wu2023autogen,hong2023metagpt}, where multiple specialized agents collaborate to solve problems more efficiently than monolithic models. This paradigm offers two key advantages: (1) \textit{parallelism} through concurrent agent execution, and (2) \textit{specialization} where each agent focuses on a specific subtask. However, applying multi-agent systems to time series analysis remains largely unexplored, with existing work~\cite{liang2024foundation} lacking mechanisms for cross-modal reasoning and numerical precision.

To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MAS4TS} (Multi-Agent System for Time Series), a novel framework that addresses the aforementioned challenges through multi-agent collaboration. Our key insight is that time series analysis benefits from \textit{dividing complex tasks into specialized subtasks handled by coordinated agents}, rather than relying on a single end-to-end model. As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:intro}, MAS4TS consists of six specialized agents coordinated by a central manager:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{Data Analyzer Agent}: Performs preprocessing, anomaly detection, and statistical feature extraction.
    \item \textbf{Visual Anchor Agent}: Converts time series to images and generates prediction ``anchors'' (confidence intervals and key points) using vision-language models.
    \item \textbf{Numerologic Adapter Agent}: Fuses multimodal information (anchors + data + semantics) for precise numerical reasoning.
    \item \textbf{Knowledge Retriever Agent}: Maintains a vector database of historical patterns for few-shot learning.
    \item \textbf{Task Executor Agent}: Invokes specialized time series models for final predictions.
    \item \textbf{Manager Agent}: Orchestrates agent execution plans and integrates results.
\end{itemize}

The core innovations of MAS4TS are \textit{visual anchoring} and \textit{numerical reasoning}. Visual anchoring leverages vision-language models to understand temporal patterns from visualizations, generating semantic priors (e.g., ``increasing trend'', ``high volatility'') and numerical anchors (confidence intervals for future values). Numerical reasoning then combines these multimodal cues with raw data through attention-based fusion, producing refined features for downstream tasks. This design enables MAS4TS to achieve superior performance across four tasks while maintaining efficiency through parallel agent execution.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=0pt]
    \item We propose MAS4TS, the first multi-agent system for general time series analysis, achieving state-of-the-art performance on forecasting, classification, imputation, and anomaly detection.
    
    \item We introduce visual anchoring and numerical reasoning as key mechanisms, where agents generate prediction anchors from visualizations and fuse multimodal information for precise inference.
    
    \item We demonstrate that multi-agent collaboration achieves better efficiency-performance trade-offs than monolithic LLMs through parallel execution and task specialization.
    
    \item Comprehensive experiments show MAS4TS outperforms baselines across multiple benchmarks while maintaining strong few-shot and zero-shot generalization.
\end{itemize}
